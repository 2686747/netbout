Netbout.com, Communication Platform
===================================

E-mail, chats, forums, instant messengers, and social networks,
plus hundreds of specific CRMs, shopping carts, ticketing systems and status
tracking websites. This is what stays between us when we want to talk to each
other. Clunky and outdated software tools dictate us their rules of
communication. We’re not in charge any more, they are.

Netbout.com is a solution that flips the situation upside down. With Netbout
we talk the way we usually do, sitting in a coffee shop face to face, while
software "helpers" assist us. They help us to exchange files, make video
calls, share links, schedule events, make online purchases, track shipment
status, etc. Netbout.com is a platform that organizes such helpers around
our plain and straight-forward online conversation. We’re in charge now,
the rules are ours.

**Netbout.com is making software to help us communicate, instead of making us to communicate through software.**

It’s a revolutionary new way of exchanging information online without any
existing competition so far.
Its market has almost no limits, our
potential clients are Fortune-500 companies, government institutions,
universities and schools, small body shops, lawyers, doctors, and
any business in the world. The concept is pending USPTO patent,
[app. no. 12/943,022](http://www.google.com/patents/US20120117164).
