                REXSL and JCABI are updated to versions 0.4.4 and 0.7
                respectively. These changes mostly affected our usage
                of com.jcabi.manifests.Manifests file.

                Class com.netbout.spi.Urn migrated to com.jcabi:jcabi-urn
                module where it fits much better, since can be reused by
                other projects.

                Deploying to Amazon EBT without using their SWAP option,
                because our INF/HUB modules are not ready fully to this
                feature and it's easier to disable it now.
