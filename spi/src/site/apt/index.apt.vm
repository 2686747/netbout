Service Provider Interface (SPI)

  Netbout.com is an open communication platform that facilitates
  online conversations between humans and computers.
  The concept is pending USPTO patent,
  {{{http://www.google.com/patents/US20120117164}app. no. 12/943,022}}.
  More details you can get at {{{http://www.netbout.com/a/en/index}}about page}}
  of the Netbout.com.

  This SPI is an open source component of the Netbout platform that
  consists of Java interfaces (and a few classes), which are implemented
  by the platform. To connect your software with the Netbout you should
  use {{{./netbout-client}<<<netbout-client>>>}}, a RESTful client.

  For unit testing of your components we recommend to use our embedded
  implementation of the SPI from {{{./netbout-lite}<<<netbout-lite>>>}}.

  Latest release of the system is running at
  {{{http://www.netbout.com}www.netbout.com}}.
  Cutting edge version you can see here:
  {{{http://test.netbout.com}test.netbout.com}} (this is a testing platform
  where the newest cutting edge features are being manually tested by our
  team).

  Released version: <<<${project.version}>>>.
